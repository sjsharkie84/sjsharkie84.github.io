   <h1>About</h1>
    <p><b>Aiten's World 2018</b><br><br>In deciding what theme I wanted to portray was a no-brainer. I wanted to explain in detail a passion of mine that I have had for several years, which was and is still playing video games. Some of the best games that I have played included Witcher 2, Batman: Arkham Origins and Elder Scrolls: Skyrim. My goal is to highlight some of the good aspects of these games. These games came out fairly recent and are considered classics in terms of graphics and gameplay.<img src="../../My Stuff/Pics/witcher.jpg" width="300" height="168" alt=""/><img src="../../My Stuff/Pics/batman.jpg" width="315" height="160" alt=""/></p>
