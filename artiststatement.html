       <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
    <p>	At a very young age I had developed a strong interest in video games. The first computer I ever owned was a "DX4", which was before Intel developed the Pentium computers. The first video game that I owned was called "Rampage: World Tour." Ever since then I would build my own computers by studying the hardware as well as software involved. I knew which video cards as well as hard drives were the latest.<p></div>
		My passion for video games is what made me want to develop my artistic skills in the first place. There was and is still a strong belief that in order to learn how to create characters as well as develop a story in a video game involves being familiar with developmental software, such as Photoshop and Illustrator. "Winning isn't Everything. It is the only thing", which was a quote by Vince Lombardi, who was the Former Coach of the Green Bay Packers. That is something I carry to this day as my inspiration.
